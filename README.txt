An application which would run on the foreground, and listens to an assigned hotkey. If pressed, the application would carry out a PrintScr function, and save the screen as an image (In a preset directory). Only for Windows.

This project was sadly developed offline, but is now pushed on GitHub for any contributions and improvements.

Tested on Windows 7 Home Edition & Windows 8 Home Edition so far.
