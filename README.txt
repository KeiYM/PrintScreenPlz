An application which would run on the foreground, and listens to an assigned hotkey. If pressed, the application would carry out a PrintScr function, and save the screen as an image (In a preset directory). Only for Windows.

This project was sadly developed offline, but is now pushed on GitHub for any contributions and improvements.

Tested on Windows 7 only so far.

Current Issues:
Using Ctrl as the PrintScreen button may disrupt Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V (Copy/Paste) on other Applications.
Uses MFC DLLs (Eg. mfc100ud.dll). For now, users require to download:
Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package
to run the program.
